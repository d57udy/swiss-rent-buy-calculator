cd swiss-rent-buy-calculator

# Open in browser (no build process required)
open index.html
```

### System Requirements
- **Browser**: Modern browser with ES6+ support (Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+)
- **Internet**: Not required (fully offline capable)
- **Storage**: Minimal (< 1MB total)

## üìã Default Parameters (Swiss Standards)

### Financial Assumptions
| Parameter | Default Value | Swiss Standard |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Down Payment | 20% | Swiss banking minimum |
| Additional Costs | 2% | Notary, registry, agent fees |
| Maintenance Rate | 1.25% | Typical Swiss property maintenance |
| Imputed Rental Value | 65% of market rent | Tax authority standard |
| Amortization Period | 10 years | Common mortgage term |
| Marginal Tax Rate | 23.6% | Freienbach/Schwyz example |

### Market Parameters
| Parameter | Conservative | Optimistic |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Property Appreciation | 0-2% annually | 2-4% annually |
| Investment Yield | 2-4% annually | 4-7% annually |
| Mortgage Rate | 1-3% annually | 0.5-2% annually |

## üßÆ Calculation Methodology

### Core Algorithm
```
Total Cost Comparison = Rental Costs - Purchase Costs

Purchase Costs = Interest + Maintenance + Amortization + Taxes - Property Appreciation
Rental Costs = Rent + Supplemental Costs - Investment Returns - Opportunity Cost
```

### Swiss-Specific Adjustments
1. **Tax Optimization**: Mortgage interest and property expenses are tax-deductible
2. **Imputed Rental**: Homeowners pay tax on the theoretical rental value
3. **Investment Taxation**: Alternative investments are subject to income tax
4. **Amortization Requirements**: Mandatory principal reduction affects cash flow

## üìä Usage Examples

### Example 1: First-Time Buyer
```
Purchase Price: CHF 1,200,000
Down Payment: CHF 240,000 (20%)
Mortgage Rate: 1.2%
Monthly Rent: CHF 3,200
Result: BUY saves CHF 180,000 over 10 years
```

### Example 2: Investment Decision
```
Purchase Price: CHF 2,500,000
Investment Yield: 6%
Property Appreciation: 1%
Result: RENT saves CHF 45,000 over 10 years
```

### Example 3: Parameter Sweep
```
Property Appreciation: 0-3% (7 scenarios)  
Investment Yield: 2-6% (9 scenarios)
Mortgage Rate: 0.5-2.5% (5 scenarios)
Total Combinations: 315 scenarios analyzed
```
