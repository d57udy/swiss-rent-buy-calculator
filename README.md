## üß≠ How to Use This Calculator

Follow these steps for a clear workflow from ‚Äúfirst run‚Äù to ‚Äúdeep analysis‚Äù.

### 1) Start on the Single Calculation tab
- **Enter property basics**: `Purchase price`, `Down payment`/`Mortgage amount` and any `Additional purchase costs` or `Renovations`.
- **Mortgage & amortization**: Choose an amortization mode and check the `Annual amortization` that results (or enter manually).
- **Rent & investment assumptions**: Set `Monthly rent`, `Supplemental costs`, and `Investment yield` (for renter savings).
- **Taxes**: Either accept the defaults or use your canton‚Äôs `Imputed rental value`, `Deductions`, and `Marginal tax rate`.
- **Comparison Mode**:
  - `Equal consumption (baseline)` ‚Äî Renter invests only initial capital.
  - `Cash-flow parity (invest actual monthly difference)` ‚Äî Renter invests the positive monthly difference and withdraws when negative.
  - `Equal savings (amortization equivalent)` ‚Äî Renter contributes the buyer‚Äôs amortization each year.
- Click `Calculate` to see the decision, monthly snapshot, and detailed breakdowns.

Tips:
- The monthly boxes show budget cash flow; the decision banner reflects long‚Äëhorizon economics including asset value and investments.
- Hover the mode badge for a tooltip describing the selected comparison behavior.

### 2) Explore the Max Bid Finder
- Open the `Maximum Bid Finder` tab. It inherits all inputs (including the selected comparison mode).
- Set the search range and tolerance; run the search to find the highest price you can pay while breaking even with renting.
- Use the pivot-style results and CSV export for negotiation planning.

### 3) Run a Parameter Sweep
- Open the `Parameter Sweep` tab. It also inherits the current comparison mode and inputs.
- Configure ranges for property appreciation, investment yield, and mortgage rate.
- Run the sweep to visualize `BUY` vs `RENT` across conditions and export results as CSV.

### 4) Save / Load Scenarios
- Use the `üíæ Save Parameters` button to download a JSON file containing all inputs, including `scenarioMode`.
- Use `üìÅ Load Parameters` to restore a saved session; all fields and the selected mode will be reapplied.


### System Requirements

- **Storage**: Minimal (< 1MB total)

## üìã Default Parameters (Swiss Standards)

### Financial Assumptions
| Parameter | Default Value | Swiss Standard |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Down Payment | 20% | Swiss banking minimum |
| Additional Costs | 2% | Notary, registry, agent fees |
| Maintenance Rate | 1.25% | Typical Swiss property maintenance |
| Imputed Rental Value | 65% of market rent | Tax authority standard |
| Amortization Period | 10 years | Common mortgage term |
| Marginal Tax Rate | 23.6% | Freienbach/Schwyz example |

### Market Parameters
| Parameter | Conservative | Optimistic |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Property Appreciation | 0-2% annually | 2-4% annually |
| Investment Yield | 2-4% annually | 4-7% annually |
| Mortgage Rate | 1-3% annually | 0.5-2% annually |

## üßÆ Calculation Methodology

### Core Algorithm
```
Total Cost Comparison = Rental Costs - Purchase Costs

Purchase Costs = Interest + Maintenance + Amortization + Taxes - Property Appreciation
Rental Costs = Rent + Supplemental Costs - Investment Returns - Opportunity Cost
```

### Swiss-Specific Adjustments
1. **Tax Optimization**: Mortgage interest and property expenses are tax-deductible
2. **Imputed Rental**: Homeowners pay tax on the theoretical rental value
3. **Investment Taxation**: Alternative investments are subject to income tax
4. **Amortization Requirements**: Mandatory principal reduction affects cash flow

### Single Calculation In-Depth

The "Single Calculation" tab is the core of the calculator, providing a head-to-head financial comparison between buying a property and renting a comparable one over a specified time period. It synthesizes user inputs to model both scenarios according to Swiss financial regulations and market practices.

#### Execution Flow

When the user clicks the **"Calculate"** button, the following steps occur:

1.  **Input Gathering**: The application collects all values from the input fields in the "Single Calculation" tab. These inputs are converted to the correct numerical formats (e.g., percentages are converted to decimals).
2.  **`calculate` Function Call**: The gathered parameters are passed as a single object to the `SwissRentBuyCalculator.calculate(params)` static method in `calculator.js`.
3.  **Scenario Modeling**: Inside the `calculate` function, two distinct financial scenarios are modeled in parallel: the **Purchase Scenario** and the **Rental Scenario**.
4.  **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: The total net costs of both scenarios are calculated. The final recommendation is determined by comparing these two totals.
5.  **Result Display**: The comprehensive results, including the final "BUY" or "RENT" decision, the financial advantage, and a detailed cost breakdown, are formatted and displayed in the results section of the UI.

##### Comparison Modes
- **Equal Consumption (default, baseline)**: Renter invests only the initial capital not tied up in the property (down payment + purchase costs). Amortization is treated as equity building on the buy side and not mirrored as renter savings.
- **Cash-flow parity (invest actual monthly difference)**: Renter invests, each year, the positive difference between the buyer‚Äôs monthly cash outflow (interest + amortization during the amortization period + maintenance) and the renter‚Äôs monthly outflow (rent + supplemental costs). Contributions vary by year, compound at the investment yield, and investment income is taxed. No withdrawals are modeled when the difference is negative.
- **Equal savings (amortization equivalent)**: Renter also contributes an amount each year equal to the buyer's amortization during the amortization period; those contributions compound at the investment yield and investment income is taxed.

###### Deeper logic and guidance
The two modes answer different behavioral questions. Both are valid, but serve different purposes.

- **Equal Consumption (user-cost baseline)**
  - Purpose: Compare the economic cost of housing services with typical banking/regulatory framing.
  - Mechanics:
    - Buy: unrecoverable costs (interest, maintenance, net taxes) minus the asset value at end, plus remaining mortgage.
    - Rent: rent + rental costs. The renter invests only the upfront capital not tied into the home (down payment + purchase costs). Investment income is taxed at your marginal rate.
    - Buyer amortization is not treated as a cost; it is equity building and is already captured via ‚Äú‚àí property value + remaining mortgage‚Äù.
  - When to use: Baseline comparisons; affordability framing; common in professional calculators.

- **Cash-flow parity (invest the actual monthly difference)**
  - Purpose: Model a renter who invests precisely the real monthly budget advantage relative to buying.
  - Mechanics:
    - Compute each year the cash-flow difference: (buyer monthly costs ‚àí renter monthly costs) √ó 12; when negative, it is modeled as a withdrawal. Contributions/withdrawals compound at the investment yield; investment gains are taxed.
    - Rental total cost subtracts the algebraic sum of principal contributions (investments minus withdrawals) along with the original down payment.
  - When to use: ‚ÄúWhat if I invest whatever I actually save in monthly cash flow?‚Äù scenarios; sensitivity to budget outcomes.

- **Equal savings (amortization-equivalent)**
  - Purpose: Test disciplined saving behavior where the renter commits to invest an amount equal to the buyer‚Äôs amortization each year.
  - Mechanics:
    - In addition to the initial invested capital, the renter contributes the annual amortization for each year of the amortization period; contributions compound at the investment yield; investment gains are taxed.
    - Rental total cost subtracts both the invested down payment and the amortization-equivalent contributions (principal), mirroring the buyer‚Äôs equity build.
  - When to use: Sensitivity when market returns are expected to exceed property appreciation; ‚Äúwhat if I invest with the same discipline as amortization?‚Äù

Notes:
- Monthly expenses boxes are informational; the modes primarily change the long-horizon net-cost comparison by altering renter savings behavior.
- Max-bid and parameter sweep inherit the selected mode from the Single Calculation tab.

---

#### Output Value Generation

Here is a detailed breakdown of how each output value in the results section is calculated:

##### <u>Decision & Net Financial Benefit</u>

-   **Decision (`Decision`)**:
    -   This is the final recommendation: **BUY**, **RENT**, or **EVEN**.
    -   It is determined by the `ResultValue`. If `ResultValue` is positive, the decision is "BUY". If negative, it's "RENT". If zero, it's "EVEN".
-   **Financial Benefit (`ResultValue`)**:
    -   This is the ultimate output of the calculation, representing the net financial advantage of one option over the other over the entire analysis period.
    -   **Formula**: `ResultValue = TotalRentalCost - TotalPurchaseCost`
    -   A positive value indicates the amount (in CHF) that buying saves you compared to renting. A negative value indicates how much renting saves you.

##### <u>Core Scenario Costs</u>

-   **Total Purchase Cost (`TotalPurchaseCost`)**:
    -   This represents the total, all-inclusive cost of owning the property over the analysis term, factoring in the eventual sale of the asset.
    -   **Formula**: `TotalPurchaseCost = (Direct Costs + Tax Impact) - Final Property Value + Remaining Mortgage Debt`
    -   **`Direct Costs (`generalCostOfPurchase`)`**: Sum of all cash outflows: `InterestCosts` + `SupplementalMaintenanceCosts` + `AmortizationCosts` + `RenovationExpenses` + `AdditionalPurchaseExpensesOutput`.
    -   **`Tax Impact (`taxDifferenceToRental`)`**: The net tax cost or benefit of owning vs. renting.
    -   **`Final Property Value (`propertyValueEnd`)`**: The appreciated value of the property at the end of the term, treated as a "negative cost" or a final asset value.
    -   **`Remaining Mortgage Debt (`mortgageAtEnd`)`**: The outstanding mortgage principal at the end of the term, which is still a liability.

-   **Total Rental Cost (`TotalRentalCost`)**:
    -   This represents the total financial impact of renting over the same period.
    -   **Formula**: `TotalRentalCost = (Total Rent Payments + Additional Rental Costs) - Investment Returns - Initial Capital`
    -   **`Total Rent Payments`**: `monthlyRent * 12 * termYears`.
    -   **`Investment Returns (`yieldsOnAssets`)`**: The compounded return on the `investableAmount` (down payment + initial purchase costs) that a renter would have earned by investing that capital instead.
    -   **`Initial Capital (`downPaymentOutput`)`**: The initial down payment is subtracted because it is considered principal that is returned at the end of the analysis (unlike the purchase scenario where it is tied up in the property).

##### <u>Purchase Scenario Breakdown</u>

-   **Interest Costs (`InterestCosts`)**:
    -   This is the total mortgage interest paid over the analysis period (`termYears`).
    -   **Method**: It is calculated using a **declining balance method**. A loop runs for each year of the term, calculating the interest on the *remaining mortgage balance* for that year and then subtracting the annual amortization payment before the next year's calculation. This accurately reflects how Swiss mortgages work.

-   **Total Monthly Expenses (when Buying)**:
    -   This provides a snapshot of the typical monthly cash outflow for a homeowner.
    -   **Formula**: `MonthlyInterestPayment + MonthlyAmortizationPayment + MonthlyMaintenanceCosts`
    -   **`MonthlyInterestPayment`**: The interest payment for the *first month*, calculated as `(mortgageAmount * mortgageRate) / 12`.
    -   **`MonthlyAmortizationPayment`**: `annualAmortization / 12`.
    -   **`MonthlyMaintenanceCosts`**: `annualMaintenanceCosts / 12`.

##### <u>Swiss Tax Calculation Details (`taxDifferenceToRental`)</u>

The tax calculation is one of the most complex and critical parts of the model. It runs a year-by-year simulation to determine the net tax difference between the buying and renting scenarios.

-   **For the Homeowner (Buyer)**:
    -   **Tax Cost - Imputed Rental Value**: An annual tax is levied on the `imputedRentalValue` at the `marginalTaxRate`. This is a uniquely Swiss tax on the theoretical rental income a homeowner could get from their property.
    -   **Tax Savings - Mortgage Interest**: The annual mortgage interest paid is tax-deductible, creating a tax saving equal to `annualInterest * marginalTaxRate`.
    -   **Tax Savings - Property Expenses**: Other `propertyTaxDeductions` (like maintenance) are also deductible, generating further savings.

-   **For the Renter**:
    -   **Tax Cost - Investment Income**: It is assumed the renter invests their initial capital (down payment + costs). The returns (`investmentYieldRate`) on this capital are subject to income tax at the `marginalTaxRate`.

The `taxDifferenceToRental` is the cumulative sum of these annual net differences over the `termYears`.
