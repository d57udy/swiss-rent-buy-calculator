  - listitem: Matches common banking and regulatory framing.

  - listitem: Contributions/withdrawals vary over time; all flows compound at the investment yield; investment income is taxed.
  - listitem: Treats savings discipline realistically and mirrors the cash budget each year.
- text: Equal savings (amortization equivalent)
- list:
  - listitem: Assumes renter also saves and invests the amortization-equivalent each year (during amortization period).
  - listitem: Those contributions compound at the investment yield; investment income is taxed.
