## Project Memories

- We are building a rent vs. buy decision tool for Switzerland.
- @readme.md contains context on the calculation logic and what we want to achieve
- For every new feature, make sure it efficiently fits into the existing architecture, always update automated tests and make sure existing tests pass, update the @readme.md as features, architecture, and tests change3/
